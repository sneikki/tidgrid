Tidgrid provides built-in CSS normalization module. Tidiness defines
a few levels, and each level is more opinionated and brings
more normalization to the web page.

### Currently supported levels
* None
* Minimal

{% include note.html type="note"
    content="As of 0.1.0, adjusting the normalization level is not
    supported. Thus, all of the normalization styles
    are applied to the web page. This is subject to change in
    a future version, however." %}
